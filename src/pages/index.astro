			<h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
			<p>
				Gamer nerd ü§ì with a (potentially?) unhealthly obsession with educating and solving problems
				for other gamers. Most call me Rio.
			</p>

			<h2 class="section-title">Projects</h2>
			<p>
				A few of the personal/passion projects (among many) that I‚Äôve desgined and built over the
				last few years. üöÄ

			<ul class="list">
				{PROJECTS.map((project) => (
					<li class="list-item">

			<h2 class="section-title">Misc.</h2>
			<p>
				In my free time I like to explore my passion with
				<a href="/misc"><strong>miscellaneous side projects.</strong></a>
				These projects are important to me in a lot of ways but mainly because they're an opportunity
				for me to learn. Often times these side projects lead to much bigger things and I owe a *lot*
				of my career growth to this kind of exploration.

			<h2 class="section-title">Music 2023</h2>
			<strong><a href="/music">Follow along üé∂üéµüéº</a></strong>
			<p>
				One of my favorite feelings is driving home from work, turning on my Discover Weekly, and
				stumbling on to an instant hit that defines my mood at that moment. I have this theory that
				you can instnatly tell how good a week is going to be based on the number of those in that
				week's playlist.
			</p>
			<p>
				This year I've decided to take a stab at <a href="/music">documenting some of these gems</a>
				that strike me week by week. Who knows maybe I'll give up on it at some point but having them
				in preverbial stone will be a nice way to look back and find them again. Who knows maybe I'll
				do one for movies this year as well (much more attainable).

			<h2 class="section-title">Movies 2023</h2>
			<strong><a href="/movies">Follow along üé•üé¨üçø</a></strong>
			<p>
				Similar to the above music diary, I plan to catalogue the movies I watch throughout 2023.
				Unlike the music I won't have dedicated week-by-week posts, but rather a long running list 
				of things I see as I see them (some may be movies that came out in late 2022, sorry).
