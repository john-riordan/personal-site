					Big shocker a synthwave song ðŸ˜…. The little guitar riff during the hook 
					sounds an awful lot like riff from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4PMmwowVLOajPdiKnrU1vK?si=9295301e20594854">Sunset</a> 
					by The Midnight (one of my favorite bands). 
					This is what I call driving music. I can totally jam out and belt to this.
